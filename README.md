# Graphing-Calculator
A project completed in winter 2013, it is a graphing calculator designed to display simple functions and polynomials graphically. Entered into Gannon Programming Contest.

Highlights of this project:
Parsing the equation is done recursively. The program treats each individual set of parenthesis  as its own equation. 

With the exception of Swing framework and other preprovided GUI elements, this project was made entirely from scratch.
